# WaterCooler
Connect with people around a virtual water cooler!
This PowerApp allows people to sign up, record their interests, and connect with others in 15 minute 1:1 meetings during an hour of their choice. This can be helpful when large teams work across locations or when everyone is working from home.

The files included are:
Water Cooler.msapp - The PowerApp template
WaterCoolerSchedule_20200519201617 - The PowerAutomate template for the email

You will also need to create a SharePoint list and connect it to the PowerApp. 
Create the following columns in the SharePoint list:

1. Interests

  Text field

2. Time

  Choice field
  Populate in hour increments (8-9AM, 9-10AM, etc)

3. Time Zone

  Choice field
  Populate it with relevant time zones (for example, in the US - EDT, MDT, CDT, PDT)
  
4. Created By

  This is a default column, so no need to create it, but you may want to add it to your View on the SharePoint list.

Once the SharePoint list is created, import the files to create the PowerApp and PowerAutomate.

The Water Cooler icon used was made by Creaticca Creative Agency from https://www.flaticon.com
